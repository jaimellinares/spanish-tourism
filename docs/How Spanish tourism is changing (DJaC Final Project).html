	<p>Spain and tourism are hardly detachables. Since its birth in the 50s and 60s as the prefered holiday destination of the new Western European middle class, this touristic industry has become a global champion. The <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TTCR_2017_web_0401.pdf">World Economic Forum</a> says that this is the world's most competitive destination.</p> 
	<p>With 82.6m foreign tourists received in 2018, <b>Spain is the third most visited nation of the globe</b>, according to the <a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284419876">World Tourism Organization</a>.</p>
	<p>Overall, tourism provided €173bn to the Spanish GDP in 2017 and created 2.8m jobs. That accounts for 14.9% of the whole economy and 15.1% of the job market. Let's take a closer look at this industry.</p>

	  	<p>The map above displays 2018 data and shows how <b>the UK, Germany and France </b> remain the main countries of origin. That has been so for 60 years. Geographical proximity to early industrialized Western Europe has been a historical competitive advantage for the Spanish tourism industry. </p>
	  	<p>However, the increasing reach of flight connections is allowing Spain to be visited by more Asians and Americans. As the next graph shows, travellers from <b>India</b> (+95%) and <b>China</b> (+73%) have almost doubled in just two years. <br><br></p>

	<br><br>
	  	<p>The chart above shows that <b>the fastest-increasing markets are Asia-Pacific and America</b>. On average, those visitors spend way more than Europeans. The latters' arrivals have stagnated because of the economic slowdown and the rebound of Eastern Mediterranean destinations such as Turkey and Egypt. </p> 
	  	<p>It must be noted that the variable "daily expenditure per tourist" is a little bit tricky, as it includes expenses made in origin that do not entail revenues in Spain - such as flight tickets. However, it makes sense to think that those travellers that can afford expensive tickets will also be more generous spenders after having arrived to their destination.</p>
	  	<p>Overall, average <b>daily expenditure per foreign tourist has surged by 12% since 2016, to €146</b>. One of the reasons explaining the rising profile of tourists arriving to Spain may be the characteristics of the hotel industry.</p><br>

	  	<p><h4>Where are they sleeping?</h4></p>
	  	<p> As the next graph shows, the number of <b>nights spent at 4 and 5-star hotels have tripled</b> in less than two decades. Spain has succeeded at upgrading its hotel stock.<br><br></p>

	<br><br>
	  	<p> Data on the hotel industry says a lot about Spanish tourism: in 2018, for the first time ever, <b>nights spent at 4 and 5-star suites outnumbered those at the rest of hotels and hostels combined</b>. At a time when concerns about the negative effects of hosting so much tourism are becoming noisy, attracting high-end travellers can be a turning point. </p>
	  	<p>For example, the increase in international visitors arrivals to Spain slowed down to 1.1% in 2018; however, total expenditure grew by 3.3% during the same period. This fact tells us that, through higher quality services, <b>it is possible to increase tourism revenues while leveling off the number of tourists</b>. Catalonia, where expenditure grew by 7% during the last year while arrivals remained equal, is a good example.</p>

	  	<p>The map above shows how tourists visiting Spain <b>concentrate alongside the Mediterranean coast and at the Canary Islands</b>. Excessive localization is a historical feature of Spanish tourism: some areas become overcrowded every summer while other remain unknown. However, the next chart tells us that that problem might be changing.<br><br></p>

	  	<p>If <b>delocalisation</b> is a goal for Spanish tourism regulators, data shows that they are succeeding. In the last two years, the destinations spearheading touristic growth are not the traditional ones. Overnights at northern and central regions such as <b>the Basque Country, Madrid and Aragón</b> have increased around 10% since 2016. Meanwhile, growth at leading destinations - the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and Catalonia - is more restrained. </p>
	  	<p><h4>And when are they going?</h4></p>
	  	<p>Spanish tourism excessive concentration is not such only in space, but also in time. In other words, <b>the activity overheats during the summer and vanishes in winter</b>. That has wide consequences for the job market and for the finances of local administrations, just to mention two.</p>
	  	Fortunately, data shows that <b>Spain is not only delocalising its tourism, but also deseasonalising it</b>.</p>

          <p>Actually, all those trends are related. Tourists coming from far away are not as interested in beaches as Europeans. Asian and American travellers prefer to visit cities and landmarks, hence <b>their presence allows the industry to overcome territorial and seasonal boundaries</b> (enjoying a city is less dependent on weather conditions than enjoying a beach). </p>
          <p>Those trends solve some of the problems traditionally entailed by the Spanish tourism industry. <b>Attracting tourists with a higher purchase power means that more income and, therefore, more jobs will be generated per each visitor </b>- more quality and less quantity, to put it simple.</p>
          <p>Finally, the fact that the activity is growing faster during colder months and at less visited regions will allow Spain <b>to avoid excessive saturation at coastal destinations, to spread tourism yields across the country, and to build a more stable, less seasonal job market</b>. </p>
